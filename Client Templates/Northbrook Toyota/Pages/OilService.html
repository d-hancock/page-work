				<p>Regular oil changes are an important part of vehicle maintenance and vital to your vehicle&rsquo;s health. Your
					engine contains many moving parts that become very hot when running for extended periods of time, and engine oil
					is necessary to reduce friction and keep the engine cool and free of debris. If you have questions about the oil
					change process, please read through our oil change overview below or <a href="/contact.htm">contact our service department</a> online.</p>

				<h2>Synthetic Oil vs. Conventional Oil</h2>
				<p>What is synthetic oil and how does it differ from conventional engine oil? Synthetic oil has fewer impurities
					and contains additives to improve performance. Synthetic oil is more resistant to extreme temperatures than
					conventional oil, more effective at reducing deposits of dirt and grime, and more effective at lubricating engine
					components.</p>
				<p>So which should you use at your next oil change? Synthetic oil is better for your car. Synthetic oil can also
					improve performance, potentially extend the life of high-mileage cars, and flows better in cold temperatures.
					Conventional oil is perfectly acceptable in most cars, and is a more cost-effective option. If you are unsure
					whether to use conventional or synthetic oil in your vehicle, please consult your owner&rsquo;s manual or call <a href="tel:8472720808">847-272-0808</a>
					to speak with a service technician at our Toyota dealership in Northbrook, IL.</p>

				<h2>Oil Change Intervals</h2>
				<p>Most auto service technicians recommend changing your engine oil and oil filter every six months or every 5,000
					miles, whichever comes first. If you frequently tow with your vehicle, or if the majority of your trips are under
					5 miles, in stop-and-go traffic, or in extreme heat or cold, then your engine oil will break down faster and need
					to be changed every 3,000 miles. If you are unsure when your vehicle&rsquo;s oil should be changed, please
					consult your owner&rsquo;s manual or call <a href="tel:8472720808">847-272-0808</a> to speak with a service technician at our Toyota
					dealership in Northbrook, IL.</p>
