	<h1>Audi R8 Over the Years &ndash; near Schaumburg, IL</h1>
	<p>The Audi R8 is the pinnacle of performance, design, and handling. Declared by critics across the board as an iconic
		modern supercar, the R8&rsquo;s exquisitely designed V10 engine eviscerates the road, delivering an unparalleled
		driving experience. Although only 12 years into its production, the R8 has seen several design iterations, model
		versions, and mechanical updates, so as the new model year dawns upon us we thought it was appropriate to revisit the
		history of the Audi R8. After you finish reading, check out our new <a href="/research/r8-inventory.htm">R8 inventory</a> here at Audi Hoffman Estates.</p>

			<h2 style="text-align: center;">First Generation (2006-2015)</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="col-xs-12">
			<p>Introduced in 2006, the R8 Coupe 4.2 Quattro was based on the design of the Audi Le Mans Quattro concept car,
				sharing the same chassis of the Lamborghini Gallardo. The initial production run featured the engine of the Audi
				RS4,
				a 4.2L V8 producing 417 HP and capable of 0-60 MPH in 4.3 seconds. The engine was offered with either a six-speed
				manual or a six-speed R tronic<strong>&reg;</strong> transmission. In its early years, the R8 was lauded equally
				for
				its performance and its reliability in both professional racing and consumer-facing forms.</p>

			<h3>New Engine</h3>

			<p>For the 2009 model, an optional 525 HP 5.2L V10 was added by Audi. This new engine drew even higher praise from
				industry insiders. Full LED headlights came with the addition of the new engine, a striking new look at the time.</p>

			<h3>Addition of Spyder</h3>
			<p>The R8 Spyder was first showcased in early 2009 at the Frankfurt Motor Show, but wasn&rsquo;t released until late
				2010/early 2011 with two models: the R8 Spyder 5.2 FSI quattro and the Spyder 4.2.</p>
			<h3>Redesign</h3>
			<p>In 2012, Audi put forth a slightly redesigned version of the R8, along with the R8 GT, a lightweight,
				racing-oriented 560 HP version of the 5.2L V10. Along with the performance upgrade, the GT featured weight-saving
				carbon fiber throughout the interior and exterior.</p>
