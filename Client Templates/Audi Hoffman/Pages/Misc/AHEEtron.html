            <p>What would you say to a vehicle with quattro&reg; all-wheel drive, gorgeous looks, and no need to ever stop
                at a gas station? The new Audi e-tron&reg; is an all-new, all-electric SUV from the brand with the four rings.
                The e-tron&reg; has been highly anticipated since the concept model was first unveiled at the International
                Motor Show in Frankfurt in 2015, and now registration opens for orders in just a few days at our showroom
                near Schaumburg, IL! <a href="https://www.audiusa.com/audi-life/e-tron">Reserve your Audi e-tron&reg; today</a>.</p>

                                <p>Dual-electric motors power the new e-tron&reg;: one for the front axle, and a separate
                                    one for the rear. An electric motor does not have to &ldquo;get up to speed&rdquo;. Full
                                    torque is available near instantaneously, and there is no noise, vibration, nor emissions
                                    either. The electric system of the new Audi e-tron&reg; even sends the energy generation
                                    when you brake back to the motor to power acceleration.</p>
