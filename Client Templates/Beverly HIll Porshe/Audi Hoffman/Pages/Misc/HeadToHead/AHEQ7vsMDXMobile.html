                you need while also making all the neighbors jealous. Two of those are the Audi Q7 and Acura MDX, but if

            <p>The Audi Q7 and Acura MDX both have powerful V6 engines under the hood, but for a truly dynamic driving experience,
                you need the Audi Q7. Not only does the Q7 come standard with quattro&reg; all-wheel drive for more impressive
                handling, it&rsquo;s also faster and more powerful than the Acura MDX. An adaptive air suspension is also
                available on the Q7 to provide additional ride comfort on any terrain.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6">
            <p>Both models come standard with premium comfort features, including heated leather front seats, and options
                such as ventilated front seats and heated rear seats. But you will prefer time spent inside the Q7 to time
                spent in the MDX.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Audi Q7 has more headroom and more legroom in all three rows than the Acura MDX does.</li>
                <li>The Audi Q7 comes standard with a 12-way adjustable driver&rsquo;s seat or available 18-way adjustable
                    seat with massage function. All 2018 Acura MDX models come with a 10-way adjustable driver&rsquo;s seat.</li>
                <li>The Q7 comes standard with a power-folding third row. This is not available on the Acura MDX.</li>
                <li>Only the Audi Q7 is available with four-zone climate control to provide customizable comfort for all
                    passengers.
                </li>
                <li>The Audi Q7 uses more high-end materials throughout the cabin than the Acura MDX. Genuine wood inlays
                    come standard rather than only on upper trims, and ambient LED lighting and a black Alcantara&reg; headliner
                    are also available.</li>

                and lane keeping. However, the Audi Q7 goes much further than the Acura MDX in filling the cabin with features
                sure to impress everyone who sees them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Acura MDX is available with 8, 10, 11, or 12-speaker sound systems. The Audi Q7 is available with
                    10, 19, or 23-speaker sound systems.</li>
                <li>While all 2018 Acura MDX models come with an 8-in. central display screen, the Audi Q7 is available with
                    an 8.3-in. infotainment display with a touchpad controller that can recognize fingertip-written commands.</li>
                <li>Nothing available in the Acura MDX compares to the 12.3-in. fully digital instrument panel and Head-Up
