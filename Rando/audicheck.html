	Mercedes-Benz CLA 250 starts at $33,100 MSRP. To see how these two models compare across all categories of luxury,

<h1>Audi A3 vs. Mercedes-Benz CLA 250: Interior and Exterior</h1>
<p><img src="http://pictures.dealer.com/s/schaumburgaudiaoa/1582/8cc687191923c37d93ecc550d444a84fx.jpg" style="width: 100%;"></p>
<p>Both the A3 and Mercedes-Benz CLA come with interior comfort features including power-adjustable front seats and
	standard dual-zone climate control. However, the new Audi A3 has more legroom in both rows of seating, including 8
	more inches more rear legroom than the Mercedes-Benz CLA! It has several other benefits over the Mercedes-Benz CLA 250
	as well.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The Audi A3 is available with rain-sensing windshield wipers, as well as full LED automatic headlights, automatic
		high beams, and LED taillights with dynamic turn signals.</li>
	<li>Heated front seats are standard on every new Audi A3, but they're an added cost feature on the Mercedes-Benz CLA
		250.</li>
	<li>Every new Audi A3 has real leather seats, while the Mercedes-Benz CLA 250 uses synthetic leather.</li>
	<li>A panoramic sunroof comes standard in the new Audi A3, but is an optional feature in the Mercedes-Benz CLA 250.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Audi A3 vs. Mercedes-Benz CLA 250: Technology</h1>
<p>Audi and Mercedes are both known for being on the forefront of vehicle technology. However, Audi makes most of their
	most exciting tech features available even in entry-level models like the Audi A3 while Mercedes-Benz restricts many
	of their more advanced technology features to more expensive models.</p>
